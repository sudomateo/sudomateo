= Baking a TuringPi in the Home Lab

This talk details my journey building a home lab using the TuringPi, Talos
Linux, and Kubernetes. Attendees will learn what the TuringPi is, how to flash
an operating system to its nodes, how to use Talos Linux to deploy and manage
Kubernetes, and how to observe it all with OpenTelemetry. We'll discuss the
gotchas of ARM and the TuringPi and what I wish to see released next. All
current and future home labbers welcome!
