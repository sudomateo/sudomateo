# I Just Can't Wait to Be Senior

The senior engineer level is often regarded as the "sweet spot" or "career
level" for the majority of engineers. This talk describes how engineers can
approach getting promoted to senior and what challenges await on the other
side. If you're a new engineer that wants to align your path towards senior or
a senior engineer struggling to have the impact needed to go beyond, this talk
is for you! Bring your experience and your questions and let's discuss them!
