# Pointers & Interfaces in Go

This talk describes everything a Gopher should know about pointers and
interfaces in Go. Attendees will learn how pointers are represented in memory,
the difference between pointer and value semantics, what happens as functions
are added and removed from the call stack, and how interfaces can both enable
and hinder behavior in programs. Unlike an interface, there's nothing to
implement before coming to this talk. All are welcome!
